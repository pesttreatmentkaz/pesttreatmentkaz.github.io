<p>They are selected and used in a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are required. Practically every kind of pest positions a hazard to the properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to avoid pests from ending up being a hazard.
