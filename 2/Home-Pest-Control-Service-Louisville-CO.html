<p>Go with the least poisonous (or most affordable schedule) family pesticide readily available. The majority of people typically think about pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects attempt to invade their lawns and homes, however, pests understand no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides originated from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally taking place materials.</p>
<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural opponents assists to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
<p>The behavior of the pest can be exploited for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits consisting of toxic product will bring in and kill the pests when dispersed in the field or positioned in traps. </p>
<p>Typically, the primary objective of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to include illness, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management goals of websites such as commercial and residential structures, yard and turf locations, and house and neighborhood gardens.</p>
