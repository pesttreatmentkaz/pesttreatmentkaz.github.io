<h3>Fire Ant Facts and Pest Control Wheaton IL</h3>
<p>But, we can definitely shed some light on the path to reliable pest control. Applying insecticides when natural enemies are not abundant or are less susceptible, such as when immatures are framed in host eggs, can be helpful. Ants are pests around the house because they feed on and pollute human foods, infest structures, and build unattractive mounds in yards.</p>

However, the high potential for recreation of insect pests remains, and a population surge of numerous species can be gotten out of a low-density level whenever suitable environmental conditions occur or control slackens. Under this plan, insect control was "monitored" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
