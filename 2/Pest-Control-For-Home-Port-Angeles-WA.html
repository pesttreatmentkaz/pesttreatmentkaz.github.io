<p>Not exactly sure how to get rid of cockroaches? Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control home insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about decreasing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management techniques are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>An extensive understanding of general IPM principles and numerous management choices for all possible pest issues is important as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We generally suggest pest control chemicals that get the job done using the least amount of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope). These prevention and control techniques include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulative techniques.</p>
