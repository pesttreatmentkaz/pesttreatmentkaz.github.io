<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the very same ideas as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
