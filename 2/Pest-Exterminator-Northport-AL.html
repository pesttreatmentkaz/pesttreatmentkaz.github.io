The term was first utilized as incorporated control" by Bartlett (11) and was further elaborated on by Stern et al.

Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is likewise thought about a physical control and, although it does not necessarily eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
