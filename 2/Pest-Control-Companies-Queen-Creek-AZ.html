<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dose when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
