If all other integrated pest management techniques are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is justified.</p>
<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be substantial obstacle to the growth of your business. However, some professionals analyze IPM as turning chemicals from various mode of action groups to preserve pest control effectiveness and decrease pesticide resistance with a focus on reducing pest damage.
