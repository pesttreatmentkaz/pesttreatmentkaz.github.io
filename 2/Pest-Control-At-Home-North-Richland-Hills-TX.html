Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic technique towards pest risk management by using proactive control methods. Insecticides are classified in a number of methods, and it is very important to be acquainted with these classifications so that the option of an insecticide is based on more than just how well it manages the pest.</p>
<p>The human response depends upon the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to totally get rid of the pest. Current experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for crucial examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that rely on several simultaneous approaches to obtain the desired result.</p>
<p>In referral to the concept of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on broadened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance. </p>
<p>They thought that some qualities of area-wide management are incompatible with many standard IRM techniques, however recommended that usage of biologically based control techniques, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may add to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After implementing any pest management method, check the indicator plants to evaluate if arthropod pests have been eliminated and evaluate the effectiveness and durability of control.</p>
