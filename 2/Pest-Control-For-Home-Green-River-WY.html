<p>The best method to control pests is to make your home unappealing to them. But family pests can likewise be a risk to your family.

Biological control is a lot easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>In referral to the concept of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
