Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
<p>A comprehensive knowledge of basic IPM concepts and different management alternatives for all possible pest issues is very important as some are preventive and others are curative. We generally recommend pest control chemicals that do the job using the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope).

Simply put, an effective, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm break out may be to retard its development and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, thus enhancing the parasitoids' result during subsequent generations.</p>
