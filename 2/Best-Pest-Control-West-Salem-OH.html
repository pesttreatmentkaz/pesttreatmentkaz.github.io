The goal of development need to be to safeguard and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal use of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. If collective efforts were made due to the multiple potential causes for short and long-term diseases and signs associated with direct exposure to pests and pesticides, documentation would be tough to get even.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997).

With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-effective and ecologically benign pest control method ideally suited for both little and large farmers around the world. When termites have entered a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be deemed a decision-making process in which observations (from assessment and tracking) are used to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Although the two external layers in the new design can be relevant to more than pest management, they do have a considerable influence on IPM within the whole crop production and are the driving force for farming operations. Pest control deal treatment for termites services include pre-post building and construction termite control. Pesticides with a lower EIQ Field Use Score have a lower environmental impact.</p>
