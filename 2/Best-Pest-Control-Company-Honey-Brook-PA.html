<p>If a pest or illness causes unacceptable damage in spite of preventative efforts, select an effective management method that will have the least amount of influence on other living animals and the environment. Examples include cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, selection of planting websites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
