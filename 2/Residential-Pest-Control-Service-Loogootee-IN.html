<p>Having some basic concept of the costs for different pest treatments services will definitely help you deal with them on much better terms. D's has been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Utilizing the current technology, treatments, and tools, our extremely trained, certified, and state-certified pest specialists live in the communities they service and are familiar with the pests that plague the stunning eastern states.
