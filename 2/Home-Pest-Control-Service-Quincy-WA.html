The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular evaluations. Crop losses due to diseases, arthropods, and weeds, though disputed by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the intensification of pest control.</p>
