Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic method towards pest threat management by making use of proactive control methods. Insecticides are categorized in numerous methods, and it is necessary to be acquainted with these classifications so that the choice of an insecticide is based on more than just how well it manages the pest.</p>
<p>Pest control is an incredibly important procedure owing to the truth that a variety of pests are carriers of damaging disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the obliteration of a couple of pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control professionals frequently use pheromones traps as a means to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new idea.</p>
