Use floating row covers as short-lived barriers to get plants past critical phases, such as when they are seedlings or while the pest you are preventing is most active.

<p>An extensive knowledge of basic IPM concepts and numerous management options for all possible pest issues is very important as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We generally recommend pest control chemicals that get the job done utilizing the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last resort).
