<p>The idea of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has actually remained in practice for a long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Freezer is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is caused hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a great deal of big, pricey houses, so pest control costs might be greater there because there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses. </p>
