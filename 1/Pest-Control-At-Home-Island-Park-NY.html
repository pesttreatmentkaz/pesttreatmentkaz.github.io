A single finding of any pest in a warehouse during an audit can indicate a great deal of damage to the reputation-wise and company-financial. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your possessions with toxic chemicals, damage the air quality in your home or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and only eliminates pests at the surface of the issue.</p>
