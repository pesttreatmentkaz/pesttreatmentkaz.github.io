Almost every type of pest positions a threat to the residential or commercial properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
