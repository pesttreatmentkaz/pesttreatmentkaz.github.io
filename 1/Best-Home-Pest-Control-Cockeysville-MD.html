<p>Unexpectedly discovering an invasion of pests is never ever a welcome surprise to anyone.

IPM techniques include the intro of predators and particular parasitoids (types of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can apply to a large spectrum of chemicals, including insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.</p>
<p>In addition, using pesticides versus major pests can result in secondary pests (Internal link) ending up being a problem.

<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable and broad-based  technique that incorporates practices for the financial prevention and control of pests and diseases in crops.
