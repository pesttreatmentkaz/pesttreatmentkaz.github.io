<p>Likewise, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the very same area might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control pertains to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area clean and totally free of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space between the bottom of the floor and a door.</p>
