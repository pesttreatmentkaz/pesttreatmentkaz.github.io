<h3>Environmentally Friendly Pest Control Boiling Springs South Carolina</h2>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important part of an integrated pest management programme.
