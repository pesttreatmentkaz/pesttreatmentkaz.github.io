Pest control is the guideline or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts negatively on human activities.</p>
<p>If a pest or illness triggers unacceptable damage in spite of preventative efforts, choose an efficient management method that will have the least quantity of effect on other living creatures and the environment. Examples include growing of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, selection of planting websites, trap crops, and adjusting the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
