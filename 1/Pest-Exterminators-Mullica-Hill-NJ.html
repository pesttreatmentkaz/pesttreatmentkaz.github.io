<p>Think about alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards development of new and better products with which to replace standard poisonous pesticides.</p>
<p>Established in 1967, it is the premier association of the expert pest management markets, with over 300 members throughout the country. Safety precedes for us. We only utilize environmentally-friendly and government-approved pesticides and products for our treatments that are safe for children and pets too. Seed treatment with chemical pesticides, e.g., has actually become a popular prophylactic measure in numerous crops in recent years.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have actually been routinely using a lot of these IPM strategies for decades or even generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations vulnerable to pests, or using tolerant or resistant ranges. Sovereign Pest Control and its associated companies offer quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 property owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee. </p>
<p>The cultural practices can provide considerable relief from pests if followed in a proper way. Rentokil specialists have actually handled rodents, insects and wildlife, so call us today to see what we can do for your business to keep pests away. When applied properly, herbicides are an advantage to the environment as they control the noxious weeds that would otherwise cause vast ecological damage.</p>
