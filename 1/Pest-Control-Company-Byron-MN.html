<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ).

The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has actually been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
