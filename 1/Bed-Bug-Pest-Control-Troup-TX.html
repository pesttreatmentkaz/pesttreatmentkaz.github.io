Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and usage of pest control actions that will make sure beneficial economic condition, social and eco-friendly consequences 13 and is applicable to the majority of agricultural, public health and facility pest management scenarios.</p>

Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative influence on the environment.</p>
