Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997).
