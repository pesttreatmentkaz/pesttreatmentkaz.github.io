Reliable, less dangerous pest controls are chosen initially, including extremely targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Assessment is typically among the most essential steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ).
