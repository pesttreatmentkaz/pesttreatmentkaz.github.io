<p>Uncertain how to eliminate cockroaches? Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about lowering pesticide usage.

<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be big barrier to the growth of your business. However, some specialists translate IPM as rotating chemicals from various mode of action groups to preserve pest control efficacy and minimize pesticide resistance with an emphasis on minimizing pest damage.

<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ).

The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has actually been successfully used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
