Chemical controls were to be used only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest issues, classical biological control technique is normally utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
