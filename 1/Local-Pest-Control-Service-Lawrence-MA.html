A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility throughout an audit can imply a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your personal belongings with harmful chemicals, destroy the air quality in your house or business, possibly infect food and other perishables, and just eliminates pests at the surface of the problem.</p>
