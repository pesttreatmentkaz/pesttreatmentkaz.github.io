It's possible that the duplicated usage of pesticides might be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves.

<p>This physical control puts an instant end to pests' plant-damaging days. Pesticides not included in baits or traps should typically only be applied to targeted places, not sprayed over the whole space.

TAP insulation for attics, wetness barriers for crawl spaces, and specifically crafted weather removing for garage and entry doors not just discourage rodents and other damaging pests from living and entering in your house, they're energy effective, too.</p>
