<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Also, consider how the range of plants to be grown in the same area may influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control has to do with non-lethal approaches too, such as keeping the location clean and complimentary of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the area between the bottom of a door and the flooring.</p>
