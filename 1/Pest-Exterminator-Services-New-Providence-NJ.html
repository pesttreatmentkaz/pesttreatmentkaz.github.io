<p>All nations acknowledged IPM as a preferable approach to pest control even if it was not extensively adopted. Pests are a major threat that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a wild-goose chase and resources. Biological insecticides, originated from naturally occurring microorganisms (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi ), also fall in this category.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as hazardous to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can just do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working carefully with the specialists.</p>
<p>Pest problems use opportunities for research study on the biological processes involving organisms that cause damage to crops and structures or threaten human health.
