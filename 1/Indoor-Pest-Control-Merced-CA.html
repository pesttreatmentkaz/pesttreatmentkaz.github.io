The term was first used as integrated control" by Bartlett (11) and was even more elaborated on by Stern et al. (12) in reference to the idea of incorporating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods.</p>
<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable approach that incorporates practices for the financial prevention and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Unique safety measures should be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic approach to pest control.</p>
<p>It uses a mix of practices and control techniques with the aim of avoiding issues from occurring and decreasing the requirement for pesticide intensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Likewise, consider policies and treatments that might unsuspectingly introduce pests: storage practices and devices, maintenance, and housekeeping practices. The term was later broadened to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (13 ). Subsequently, under the term IPM," numerous authors have advocated the concept of incorporating the full array of pest management practices together with production goals into a total systems technique. </p>
